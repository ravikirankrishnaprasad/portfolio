Title: 

Streamlining Software Development in Enterprises: The Power of Metrics-Driven Development

Description:

This paper introduces Metrics-Driven Development (MDD), a novel approach designed for the complexities of enterprise Cloud (full-stack) development. In the fast-evolving landscape of Cloud computing, traditional software metrics often fall short. MDD addresses this gap, offering a robust framework to enhance software quality, performance, and efficiency in Cloud environments.

## Scalable Invoice Processing System

Problem Statement: 

The SAP Concur Invoice platform faced challenges in handling an increasing volume and diversity of invoices, impacting processing efficiency and scalability.

Role and Contributions: 

As Principal Engineer, I spearheaded the development of a microservices-based Scalable Invoice Processing System. My contributions were pivotal in architecting a solution leveraging event driven design, integrating AWS SQS for message queuing with sophisticated Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) processing, and employing Kubernetes with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to ensure dynamic scalability and robust performance.

Impact: 

The implementation of this system significantly enhanced the platform's processing capability and scalability, enabling efficient handling of large invoice volumes and diverse formats, thereby improving overall operational efficiency and readiness for future growth

##  Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

Problem Statement: 

The absence of immediate insights into key performance indicators for invoice processing was impeding effective decision-making and operational efficiency.

Role and Contributions: 

Leading the creation of a Real-Time Analytics Dashboard, I was instrumental in architecting an analytics solution that leverages Elasticsearch for data aggregation for visual representation. My notable contribution included the implementation of Metrics Driven Development, enabling the generation of both business and technical metrics tailored to various user personas, from developers and product owners to stakeholders.

Impact: 

This dashboard has revolutionized the way product and engineering teams access and utilize real-time data, significantly enhancing decision-making capabilities, streamlining invoice processing, and boosting overall operational efficiency.

## API Gateway and Service Mesh Integration

Problem Statement: 

The expansion of the SAP Concur Invoice platform necessitated a more efficient method for managing the communication and service discovery among a growing network of microservices, with challenges compounded by the need to connect with services external to the SAP Concur data center.

Role and Contributions: 

I led the strategic integration of an API Gateway and Service Mesh, selecting Spring Cloud Gateway and Istio for their robust capabilities. My responsibilities extended to architecting a comprehensive integration solution that not only streamlined internal microservices communication but also established secure and efficient connections with external services. This involved close collaboration with various teams to ensure seamless deployment and integration without impacting existing functionalities.

Impact: 

This initiative markedly improved the platform's scalability, reliability, and performance. By facilitating smoother internal service communication and enabling secure connections to external services, the integration has significantly enhanced system efficiency and expanded the platform's operational capabilities beyond the confines of the SAP Concur data center.
